## Bio
Train/Sigmund is my self-indulgent eroticization of crust punks and metalheads. I could not be further from a punk: I have 0 tattoos and piercings, am politically inert, prefer quiet music, and would be crushed in the pit. Perhaps that's why I'm attracted to the unmasked audacity of this form of expression. Or, perhaps I just want to suck a pierced dick.

## Trivia

- I asked two friends what his name should be. One said Sigmund and the other said Train. I liked both so both are his name.
