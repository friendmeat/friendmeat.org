## Bio

Amani was concieved as a foil to [Jamie](/stuff/ocs/jamie/). Where Jamie is unmotivated, pretentious, brooding, and stuck in his own head, Amani is motivated, open-minded, and empathetic. Amani represents the groundedness that can be found in food, sex, music and laughter.

That being said, Amani is just as subject to the horrors as anyone else. The food industry is a nightmare that leaves him with little energy to study. It's also getting harder and harder to have patience with Jamie's abrasive personality.

## Trivia

- I used a dead deer as my Scruff profile picture for about 6 months
- 'Deer' is one of several animals I've been compared to
