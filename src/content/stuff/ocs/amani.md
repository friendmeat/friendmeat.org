## Bio

Amani was concieved as a foil to [Jamie](/stuff/ocs/jamie/). Where Jamie is unmotivated, pretentious, brooding, and stuck in his own head, Amani is meant to be more pragmatic and in touch with good things in life. That being said, he is just as subject to the existential degradation of neoliberal capitalism, and his family life is also fucked up. He wonders if nursing is a meaningful exit plan from food service or if it's just another way to keep himself occupied from introspection.

## Trivia

- I used a dead deer as my Scruff profile picture for about 6 months
- 'Deer' is one of several animals I've been assigned as a fursona
