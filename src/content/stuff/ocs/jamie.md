## Bio

Jamie is a bisexual twenty-something customer service rep and experimental noise musician. He takes everything either catastrophically seriously or not seriously enough. He's pretentious, reads too much theory, and rates high on the Columbia Suicidality Classification Rating Scale. He dresses almost exclusively in black band t-shirts and shorts. He's foiled by his boyfriend [Amani](/stuff/ocs/amani/) who knows how to emotionally regulate.

Jamie and [Amani](/stuff/ocs/amani/) form a dyad of roadkill. They are species that are most commonly encountered[^1] crushed and twisted on the shoulders of freeways.

Raccoons and their association with trash and vermin-hood are central to Jamie's character and identification as a 'noise' musician. Noise in the Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication is an incursion from the outside that impedes the ideal 1-to-1 transmission of signals over a channel. Graphs of the Model often represent noise in its own box, outside and independent of all other elements of communication. This externalization treats noise as adversarial, sublimating the fact that noise is an _inherent quality_ of the channel. In this way, 'noise' can be compared to 'waste'-- packaging to be stripped off and thrown away to access the product contained therein; that which is unwanted, worthless, repugnant, abject; that which is obselete, slow, and unaesthetic-- even while it is inherent to the very process it impedes. In chemistry, waste is the residue left over from a reaction; in economics, it's pollution and environmental degradation, which are abstracted away as '_externalities_' to the proper functioning of production. There's also 'waste of', in the sense of 'waste of time', 'waste of space', and 'waste of oxygen', which are said both of things and persons.

The raccoon-- like noise-- is an adversary to the desirable order of human affairs, i.e. they are vermin. They kill chickens, destroy crops and gardens, nest in houses and disturb trash cans.

The are also so so so so so cute.

Jamie has a difficult relationship with his father. Jamie has a half-sister.
