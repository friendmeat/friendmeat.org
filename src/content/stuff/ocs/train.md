## Bio
Train/Sigmund is my self-indulgent eroticization of crust punks and metalheads. I could not be further from a punk: I have 0 tattoos and piercings, am politically inert, prefer quiet music, and would be crushed in the pit. Perhaps that's why I'm attracted to the unmasked audacity of this form of expression. Or, perhaps I just want to suck a pierced dick.

I imagine Train/Sigmund inhabiting a kind of apocalyptic, amoral landscape. Society is crumbling but nature has yet to reclaim anything. A real "old world dying/new world struggling to be born" kind of thing. Train/Sigmund's world is filled with burning cars and homoerotic encounters. Some inspirations are photographer Stacy Kranitz' ["From The Study On Post Pubescent Manhood"](https://www.stacykranitz.com/post-pubescent) (NSFW), the opening minutes of Hisayasu Satô's [_Boko Climax_ (1987)](https://archive.org/details/Hisayasu-Sato/BokoClimax+(1987)+-+Hisayasu+Sat%C3%B4.mp4) (NSFW), Samuel R. Delany's _Hogg_ (NSFW), and the work of Dennis Cooper (NSFW).


## Trivia

- I asked two friends what his name should be. One said Sigmund and the other said Train. I liked both so both are his name.
