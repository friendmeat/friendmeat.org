### Lonelyspeck - "Wishing"

Maybe the worst thing about streaming and algorithmic recommendations is that sometimes they _work_ and give you something you _really really like_. ["All My Skin On Th Air"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItLEF1H2vqU) came up on my Sp\*tify because I forgot to turn off the autoplay feature, and Lonelyspeck has ruled my life ever since.  

I'm soooooo excited for this new album

### The Guy Edward Bartkus Pro-Mortalist Manifesto
Someone uploaded the [podcast/manifesto](https://archive.org/details/rec-pre) recorded by the guy who [bombed a reproductive health clinic in California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Palm_Springs_fertility_clinic_bombing), and he just talks about how everyone is stupid but him. I don't like that he bombed a place and hurt people, but I guess it's like, he was just a guy and his basic premise (no one asks to be born and life is primarily suffering) is true and something everyone has been struggling with since the inception of consciousness, lol. A lot of what he says actually contradicts his main points. If he stayed alive he could've worked on making better arguments.

## __what i'm watching__:
![Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles (2011)](https://fr.web.img2.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/82/85/32/19796423.jpg) 
### _Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles_ (2011)

I saw this at my local indie cinema and the main guy [Justin Duerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Duerr) was there doing a Q&A. Very cool guy.

There's a story here about pre-Y2K mysteries. At one point Duerr says he took off work to go to the library to make his first "_web search_" about the Toynbee Tiles. He connected with other interested people over forums and email. He hand-wrote letters and visited a short-wave radio convention. Now all of this happens over Reddit and Discord.

The whole time I couldn't stop thinking about Temple OS guy ([Terry Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis)), and how Temple OS was kind of his version of the Tiles. But, he publicly operated online and had a  following. While homeless in the months before his death, he still had "fans" from the internet interviewing him and egging him on. Meanwhile, Duerr decided not to keep trying to contact the Toynbee guy to allow him privacy.  

I went on 8chan to gawk at the QAnon people and instead saw a guy peeing on a stranger's head and a rape video. We've fallen from grace. Prelapsarian schizoposting was a different game.

### _The Passenger_ (2023)
One of my character flaws is that I can be queerbaited by tumblr before I even get out of bed. 

It's a Hallmark film for a target audience of Killing Stalking girlies.

## __something i liked__:
I went to a bar alone last night, got tipsy off one (1) drink, went home and put _Court and Spark_ by Joni Mitchell on my record player and laid on the floor, then went to bed. That was nice.
## __something i hated__:
### read-it-later app shutdowns 
I started using Omnivore last year and then it [shut down to join a fucking AI audio company](https://substack.com/home/post/p-150890430). Then I switched to Pocket and now [it's shutting down](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket). Lol. 

I tried self-hosting [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) but it never extracted text correctly and is generally kind of rough. 
### the current state of my mental health
it's bad
