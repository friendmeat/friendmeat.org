## over break i...
### bought and installed a TV mount
If you've ever been in the middle of a frozen lake and started hearing the ice crack, you'll know how I felt hearing the noises emitting from my apartment's centenarian studs as I hand-drove bolts into them.
### reorganized my AV cabinet
I was able to clear a whole shelf, now I'm tempted to get a DVD player for the only DVD I own: a signed copy of [Pizza Guy 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BTPgwemfZw) (2025, dir. Tate Hoffman).
### dual-booted arch linux and ubuntu
I am now an **Arch User™**. I formatted and re-partitioned my laptop's 1TB SSD to get a separate partition for `/home`, Ubuntu and Arch. I'm keeping Ubuntu because Arch is like a feral dog whose respect and trust you have to earn. I need a safe and cozy operating system to fall back on.
### bought and used a soldering iron
I bought a $80 soldering station to fix a reading lamp that was maybe $10 off A\*\*\*\*n.

I showed my friend this and he said "jesus". It's my first time!!! Leave me alone!!!

### drank several liters of alcohol
I bar-hopped on New Years Eve and drank, in order:
1. 3 High Noon vodka iced teas (pre-game)
2. 1 Vodka Cranberry
3. 1 Unidentified martini
4. 1 Green tea shot
5. 1 White Claw (unknown flavor)
6. 1 Stella Artois

I ended up at the gay bar dancing with a rubber duck I'd won from a claw machine and named Douglas.

### played 50 hours of TF2

To round out the holy trinity of male chauvinist pass-times (drinking, putting holes in things, and video gaming), I've played north of 50 hours of TF2 during the break. I've also been putting on DJ Twitch streamers so I don't have to pick my own soundtrack. 

## my new years resolution
I'm gonna draw every day.

i want to redevelop a relationship with visual art. I've had less time (due to working full-time) and motivation (due to finally getting medicated) to draw, and when I've tried to revisit it I get disgusted at how rusty I've gotten. I want to make something every day. It doesn't have to be a complete work-- a doodle, sketch, scribble, MS-Paint pixel art, anything. My weekly blog posts have, if nothing else, reinforced the idea I can have some level of discipline and routine in doing stuff.
