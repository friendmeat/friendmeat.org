## __what i'm reading__:
### naked lunch
> Rock and Roll adolescent hoodlums storm the streets of all nations. They rush into the Louvre and throw acid in the Mona Lisa’s face. They open zoos, insane asylums, prisons, burst water mains with air hammers, chop the floor out of passenger plane lavatories, shoot out lighthouses, file elevator cables to one thin wire, turn sewers into the water supply, throw sharks and sting rays\[...] play chicken with passenger planes and busses, rush into hospitals in white coats carrying saws and axes and scalpels three feet long; throw paralytics out of iron lungs (mimic their suffocations flopping about on the floor and rolling their eyes up), administer injections with bicycle pumps, disconnect artificial kidneys, saw a woman in half with a two-man surgical saw, they drive herds of squealing pigs into the Curb, they shit on the floor of the United Nations and wipe their ass with treaties, pacts, alliances.

-- _Naked Lunch_ by William S. Burroughs

this is my idea of a good time

## __what i'm listening to__:
### Alice Glass
![Alice Glass - Catch and Release](https://youtu.be/X34KEUo1o9s?si=P7YXzTeI3d7wherK)

there's maybe no one im rooting harder for than alice glass. 

## __what i'm watching__:
### Shifty

i've read [some criticism](https://www.velcro-city.co.uk/vibeshifty-on-adam-curtis/) about adam curtis's _shifty_ being reductive and unfocused. so be it! inject this shit straight into my veins. i loved all eight un-narrated hours of [Russia 1985-1999: traumazone ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSjQL8MYniTTLA3wnZ25U-s6RgR4uJNvL), and _shifty_ is doing the same thing.

### being gay sucks

![being gay sucks](https://youtu.be/aQVdhLG23Pk?si=3i5p6csLDRMmJGHN)

it's true and someone should say it. 

## __what i'm playing__:
### Under | Heaven
r.i.p. itch.io I guess. where's that quote about how we're dumbing down the internet for kids and simultaneously erasing children's spaces online? was it lee edelman?

It's only up to chapter two and the story hasn't grabbed me so far. But I'm just picky, so maybe that will change! nevertheless it's hitting some sweet spots:
- sci-fi jargon. I love the mouthfeel of the phrase _jail-broken instances_ and _the Exchange_ and _gen two's_. 
- what little we've learned about the world so far is enticing. it's the type of premise dystopian YA authors wish they were writing about.
- The CGs are a feast. I'm an especially big fan of [tuskito's](https://tuskito.neocities.org). 

## __something i liked__:
### how to build a bomb 💣
Imagine a world where the internet is a minefield for bots that are too illiterate to read robots.txt. With this one simple trick, we could make that a reality.

A neat little blog post was deposited into my rss feed that teaches you how to build a valid HTML gzip bomb to fuck over the web scrapers that are DDoS'ing the internet: [A valid HTML zip bomb](https://ache.one/notes/html_zip_bomb)

The author describes a method of creating an HTML file that's reasonably-sized on the server but explodes to ___1000x its size___ once the client decompresses it. Since the web scrapers used to train LLMs run on cheap, memory-light hardware, this would probably crash the system. 

## __something i hated__:
### customizing neovim is easy. just write your own LSP
every time i duckduckgo "nvim how to x" it's someone on SO/Reddit being like "easy! just set up this rube goldberg machine of plugins and custom keybindings". I just want a setup between [vi](https://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/) and [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) where it's more comfortable but not so overburdened that I don't know what the fuck everything does.
