## __what i'm reading__:
### The introduction to _When Species Meet_ by Donna Haraway
I liked Donna Haraway reading Deleuze & Guatarri for filth:

>D&G continue, ‘_Anyone who likes cats or dogs is a fool_’ (240, italics in original). I don’t think that Deleuze here is thinking of Dostoevsky’s idiot, who slows things down and whom Deleuze loves. D&G go on: "Freud knows only the ‘dog in the kennel, the analyst’s bow wow.’" Never have I felt more loyal to Freud. D&G go even further in their disdain for the daily, the ordinary, the aﬀectional rather than the sublime...
> Despite the keen competition, I am not sure I can ﬁnd in philosophy a clearer display of misogyny, fear of aging, incuriosity about animals, and horror at the ordinariness of ﬂesh, here covered by the alibi of an anti-Oedipal and anticapitalist project. It took some nerve for D&G to write about becoming-woman just a few pages later!

### _Decrypting Rita_ by egypt urnash
https://egypt.urnash.com/rita/chapter/01/

I got here from a winding path. The blog post [Single Sign-on for Furries](https://cendyne.dev/posts/2025-08-15-single-sign-on-for-furries.html) was dropped into my feed reader, and it's so wonderfully try-hard. We don't get that a lot these days. It has asides from the author's fursona with illustrated reaction images.

It features one particular interstitial image that's a collab with the author and [Egypt Urnash](https://egypt.urnash.com/) that links to [Egypt's site](https://egypt.urnash.com/). Their whole portfolio is a feast, but I clicked on _Decrypting Rita_ because it's their only complete work.  

_Decrypting Rita_ is bold in every way: its horizontal-scroll format, its parallel, bifurcated storylines, and the artist's acrobatic handling of its constrained color palette. I like accurate use of real software terms. 

## __what i'm listening to__:
### "Untitled" - The Cure
![Untitled (2010 Remaster) - The Cure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfG7-NR6FD8)

_Disintegration_ is some peak nighttime driving music.  

## __what i'm watching__:
### "love yourself forever" by shitty kickflips

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g8VOHhwQAM)

this is true cinema. i'm a lily for real.

## __something i liked__:
### house show 
i almost didn't go to a house show that was advertised in my local gay coffee shop because I left my car keys at work, but I'm very glad I made it. Maybe like 10 people max in a very small 1-bedroom house in a very quiet neighborhood by a river. The headliner wore a sequin dress and a judge's wig and sang about [Dragon Ball cosplayers falling in love](https://noahbritton.bandcamp.com/track/true-love).

Talked to a guy about 100 gecs and kanye west, and he recommended I listen to [city morgue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAZ3dTVii_M)-- and you know what? I like it. Trap-metal is crazy.

## __something i hated__:
### getting debian to auto-install from a USB
I tried three different tools that purported to build auto-install Debian images, none of which worked. I spent two days on this shit. Why is it so hard? I resorted to modifying `grub.cfg` to just load the preseed file, but now I think I corrupted the USB drive.

This is an outtake from the datamoshing I was doing with audacity for the headers of my blog posts about spotify: [things i hate about spotify that have nothing to do with the business model](https://friendmeat.org/blog/2025/08/19/things-i-hate-about-spotify-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-the-business-model/) and [my streaming music stack](https://friendmeat.org/blog/2025/08/20/my-streaming-music-stack/).
