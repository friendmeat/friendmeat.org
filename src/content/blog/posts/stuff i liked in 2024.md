it's what you've all been waiting for

## Zoloft
Everything is just kind of okay now. I still have all my bitterness and nihilism, but it's more fun and less myopic angst. I will say being medicated makes me daydream about writing, since the characters I think about are all just depression tulpas.  
## Sucking Dick
Let's get one thing straight: I hate sex. Sex is a pissing contest. It's been none of the things people claim it is. Once I started having sex I realized no one is interested unless I can achieve some physical feats: taking it up the ass, coming multiple times in a row, and choking on dick.

So when I say I 'like' sucking dick, it's more accurate to say I've felt the thrill of a physical act of courage. Getting a man to ejaculate in my mouth is  the comparable to performing a throw in self-defense class. Now I have a way to gain power over someone.
## Cranberry, Walnut and Goat Cheese Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Hand-Breaded Chicken Breast 
A third thing I like to put in my mouth. I'm not good at cooking so I just make the same things every day until I get sick of them. I make this salad every day. Sometimes I use apple instead of chicken. It's really good.
## Student Protests
I originally put this in here to complain about how the mainstream media treats the public as totally gullible, as if the Palestinians have no voice whatsoever in the world. Now, I have to hand it to them. The United States is, in fact, a country of complete and utter suckers. 
## _Rigsby, WI_ by s.e. case
I can't comment authoritatively on storytelling or the craft of comics at all. All I can say is I feel intimate with these pages. I see myself and people I've loved in these characters, the mistakes they make and the bullshit they suffer.  I could only hope anything I may write would have a fraction of of the juice of [Rigsby, WI](https://rigsbywi.com/comic/comic1/). 

## RSS Readers
I've long since culled instagram, an unmitigated torrent of reasons to suicide bait; and facebook, a panopticon where my ex-coworkers can cyberstalk me; from my life. I spend more time wondering why I'm on twitter and tumblr than actually reaping some kind of value from them. Bluesky is more of the same. You won't catch me dead on tiktok. It's all cooked. 

But RSS-- sweet, innocent RSS. It's quaint in its simplicity, pointing back to a time when the internet had yet to foment any genocides. It doesn't even have any native tracking! Then how are you supposed to monetize?!?! Don't fucking worry about it! 

I mentioned RSS to my therapist as a tactic I'm using for protecting my mental health. It's great because there's no comment section, no replies, no likes, no character limit, no analytics, no algorithm. Even better: the only people that write blogs and newsletters with RSS feeds are even bigger nerds than me.  

## _Breaking Bad_
Great for knitting

## My YouTube Algorithm
I know I just had my soapbox about social media and shit, but hear me out. I've trained my YouTube algorithm to show me random shit with less than 100 views. I get all kinds of great shit, like [Squirrel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRGqwb3KDiQ) and this [DIY arena rock anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-mrJrYaObs) that would've sent a million boomers scrambling for their lighters if it were released in 1995. 

## Loneliness
Yes, reader. Loneliness has made me spiteful and weird. But it's also a consequence of self-acceptance.

Making friends, dating, and building relationships have been challenging for me-- I won't try to dig into the tedious aetiology. Loneliness is a symptom of protecting my peace from my own social ineptitude and abrasiveness.
