### the body in the back garden
![The Body in the Back Garden by Mark Waddell](https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9781639104406)

ive watched too many true crime youtubes to not cinemasins-out on the way the police mishandle the case in this book. maybe they don't have miranda rights, warrants, due process or 4th amendment rights in canada? 

<details>
<summary>my 95 theses on cozy cop malfeasance</summary>
the cops:
<ul><li>announced evidence in the presence of the prime suspect</li>
<li>did not detain the guy living in the house where a body was found</li>
<li>allowed the guy <i>back</i> into the house where he could destroy evidence</li>
<li>main cop conducts the interrogation in his office instead of an interrogation room</li>
<li>main cop does not recuse himself from the case for having a conflict of interests (childhood friends with prime suspect (who is never treated as a suspect))</li>
<li>main cop does not use their friendship to build rapport with the suspect (reid technique)</li>
<li>confront prime suspect with evidence of perjury in an uncontrolled environment, emotionally charged, and <i>still</i> does not detain him.</li>
<li>let the prime suspect remain living <i>in the crime scene</i>.</li>
<li>have no warrant to enter a suspect's trailer, have no probable cause, no plain view, no exigent circumstance, rendering all evidence inadmissable</li>
<li>no suspect is ever mirandized </li>
<li><i>again</i>, let the <i>prime suspect meddle</i> in police business, including in <i>interrogations</i>. do they just do things different in canada?</li>
<li>brought the prime suspect <i>to another suspect's home</i>, where he then <i>forced his way in</i></li>
<li>brought the prime suspect into another suspect's interrogation</li>
</ul>
luckily, none of this matters because the perpetrator reveals themself and confesses, meaning none of these miscarriages of justice face scrutiny, and the protagonist gets to ride off into the sunset with his cop boyfriend.

aside from that, a strong pass.

### Cameron Winter is a Gen Z Icon in the Making
i really liked [@rabbitechoes.indieanthro.org's review of the Geese frontman's career so far](https://medium.com/@rabbitechoes/cameron-winter-a-gen-z-icon-in-the-making-79e18743371f), and it's inspired me to dig back into them. I heard ["Low Era"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__bi2jKX_AU) debut on the radio way back when and I still come back to it all the time. it's just such a groove. 

Nevertheless, I can't condone the impulse to crown a generational spokesperson since we can find a lot of those still caught in culture's treads. IDK.

a strong student film. an inventory of functional tropes.

improv is bloodless masochism. everyone within and witnessing an improv troupe is subjecting themself to psychic torture. and that's why i fully endorse all improv to be filmed and released as short films.   

## __what i'm playing__
### sokoban

[this little guy sure can push those boxes](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/sokoban.html)

## __something i liked__:
### punk protest performance at pathetic pity party "heterofest"
![Daniel Hamrick ~ Boy (live @ Hetero Awesome Fest)](https://youtu.be/5tXnSnJZt7I?si=GqVF6E6ZulGagQiA)

This whole thing is very 2012. Some freaks still trying to make straight pride happen, then get performance-bombed by a very 2012 folk-punk. It would be kind of funny and quaint if the whole vibe right now wasn't so third reich.

## __something i hated__:
the only person of color in my unit got laid off. fuck this shit.
