## __what i'm reading__:
### _Black Sun_ by Rebecca Roanhorse
This book is brave enough to ask: what if doing hand stuff could be really tragic? 

## __what i'm listening to__:
### RADIO STUCK
> _It's cosmic! It's cosmic!_
<cite>-- David Lynch</cite>

[RADIO STUCK](https://nickyflowers.com/blog/2025/post_120325)

An invisible constellation of technical snafus bears amaranthine fruit; the apparent accidentality: vast and ineffable-- as though by the grace of some beneficient universal consciousness. A G-d type beat fr fr.

## __what i'm watching__:
### the films of Hisayasu Satô
content warning: rape

Pink films are amazing. They're thin plots sandwiched between interminable sex scenes that are simultaneously gratuitous and chaste. You'll see copious nipples and asses but neither bulge nor camel-toe. It's a genre of perfect double-threats: awful movies with shitty porn. It's made for me.

And, just my luck!: some kind soul on archive.org [uploaded a rip](https://archive.org/details/Hisayasu-Sato) of Vinegar Syndrome's _Pinku Eiga Collection_, a compilation of films by one of the "Four Heavenly Kings of Pink", [Hisayasu Satō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisayasu_Sat%C5%8D). 
#### _Abnormal Ingayaku_ (1988)
A female "crime hunter", seeking to identify the cameraman behind a snuff film, uses a chance encounter with the steward of an adult video arcade to investigate the porn industry. Will she find the killer cameraman-- or will he find her first? 
#### _BokoClimax_ (1987)
No subtitles so IDK what the FUCK happened, but I was very moved by the wordless 10-minute intro where, after some surreal imagery, a woman gets molested in a seaside dump by someone in a full black leather biker outfit. I liked the landscape and the sensual knife play. Maybe *I* would like some sensual knife play with a faceless biker guy?
#### _Bondage Ecstasy_ (1989)
This one's gay! Also not subtitled. I think a fencer at a boarding school starts having fever dreams where school administrators and office salarymen have BDSM sex.
## __what i'm playing__:
see "what I'm working on"
## __what i'm working on__
I'm doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the first time. I keep getting stuck but I'm too insecure about not being a compsci major to read the subreddit for help because they all know how to do math and I don't.

## __something i liked__:
the [`<marquee>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/marquee) element works on reading mode in Firefox in android??? I found out when looking at the abovementioned nicky flowers [RADIO STUCK blog post](https://nickyflowers.com/blog/2025/post_120325). That's crazy.

## __something i hated__:
i did some hellraiser shit to callouses on my thumb after fingering drywall for 2 hours and now it's really yeouch.
