## __what i'm reading__:
### _Blue Flag_
![Two panels from the manga Blue Flag. Text reads: "Dudes are pals. Because they're pals, I don't get those kinds of feelings for them. And cuz I don't have those feelings for 'em, they're just pals."](https://i.postimg.cc/XvvK0ywN/Screenshot-20250909-224644-Firefox.jpg)

Watching _The Summer Hikaru Died_ has caused me to backslide emotionally into a desire to read tenderqueer BL slop instead of my usual diet of, like, Peter Sotos.

I returned to _Blue Flag_ like a pacing tiger to a corner of its enclosure, seeking stimulation in familiar disappointments. Its strength is the circuitous conversations its teenagers have about their emotions: angst, yearning, being closeted, struggling with self-image, anxiety-- all couched in the unbearable tropes a corny high-school love triangle. 

In an unearned anticlimax, the male leads end up together-- after a time skip. _Blue Flag_ is densely introspective up to this point, then just glazes over a lot of tantalizing character development: how did the relationship develop in the context of the events of the manga?; what did their reunion look like?; and, most bafflingly, _when did the protagonist go gay_?

His gay yearning is so sublimated as to be homeopathic. In fact, the final chapter plays on this subtlety to pull off a _gotcha!_: we're lead to believe it's illustrated in the first-person from the lead male's perspective until he himself appears, revealing it's from the _other_ guy's perspective, and in the final panel we see their clasped hands with conspicuously matching wedding bands. 

At least tell us who tops.

## __what i'm watching__:

### _Lightmare_ (2018) dir. Josh Drake
https://vimeo.com/607632458

This was my favorite of a series of DIY avant-guard 16mm films shown during a local film festival. I hate to be _that guy_, but the digital upload doesn't do justice to the in-person screening, with the full force of the theater sound system.  It's ominous, disorientating, worldmaking. 

## __what i'm playing__
### _pedantle_
Here's my opening play for [pedantle](https://pedantle.certitudes.org/): 
1. be
2. the
3. a
4. to

"_be_" gets automatically conjugated to all its forms, so that pretty much gives you the framework of every sentence. 

"_the_" and "_a_" start giving you an idea of if the article is about a _thing_ or a _concept_.  

"_to_" starts filling out prepositions, which gives you a feel for the flow of sentences.

I can figure out _pedantle_ more reliably than I can [_cemantle_](https://cemantle.certitudes.org/), so after I finish pedantle I plug in whatever the solution was to start cemantle. It doesn't usually help.

## __what i'm working on__:
### OOP design patterns

trying to do something more complicated in ebitengine than [making sprites bounce around](https://friendmeat.org/blog/2025/09/06/weeklies-18-fantasizing-about-chasing-senators/) is very difficult. While doing research I found [_Game Programming Patterns_](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom, which is very accessible-- too accessible. I want to reinforce my delusional self-perception of being a "smart person" who can "learn things," so I decided I'd go one better and read [_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). So now I've read the introductions to both of them and none of the design patterns. I'm really smart.

## __something i liked__:
### his neck just did that on its own
<details><summary>TW: Offensive</summary>
<p>I watched the footage over and over again. It's just beautiful. When was the last time we had this kind of high-fidelity footage of the blood evacuating a political goon's head? R. Budd Dwyer? Beautiful.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend to virtue signal: I crave violence on the policy/pundit stratum. And why am I supposed to care about 'the backlash'? Everything is already going to get worse. The powers that be are already bent toward extermination. That's out of my hands.</p>
<p>As much as I enjoy political violence from the sidelines, I'm not interested in contributing to the pain in the world. The only thing I can do is be kind and helpful to the people immediately accessible to me.</p>
</details>

## __something i hated__:
### flesh dissimulator
flesh simulator [adopted the cadence of a CIA asset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eIauKTtn10) to call for the state execution of a guy who brutally murdered a random woman for no reason. the whole situation is just stomach churning and sad, and on top of that it's upsetting to have this guy whom I otherwise respect hop on the squawking punditry grift to impart the lesson on us that... the U.S. justice system gives people too many chances? psyop behavior.
