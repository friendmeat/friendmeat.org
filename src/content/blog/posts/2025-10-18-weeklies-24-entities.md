description: dystopian genderfuckery in Amiyatzin Buentello's "ELECTRONIC EYE",
  website woes, and sissy sorrows.
---
this morning there was a man behind me, yelling to no one: "fuckin' cops you know what they do when they put you in their car there are ENTITIES in there. fucking ENTITIES". my ankle hurts. the newly-installed digital signage at the burger place is already broken and flashing in red, green, blue cycles. i ran into my butch dyke cousin at the protest. tomorrow I'm flying to the midwest. 

## __what i'm reading__:
### "ELECTRONIC EYE: The Promotion"

> The checkpoint PMC guards had glared at her. She did not think they suspected her of being a woman. They had stared at her nose long enough that they were probably wondering in their heads if ‚ÄúMeunier‚Äù was some kind of gypsy name. To her knowledge, it was not. The types of PMC goon who operated the checkpoints had their own opinions on¬†_which_¬†persons of european decent should qualify for C1-M and C2-F status; Praxus had been generous to amateur race scientists with a capacity for extreme violence, but their logic was a crucible which wanted for new people to burn.

[Amiyatzin Buentello on Substack](https://amiyatzin.substack.com/p/electronic-eye-8ec)

A near-future fascist ethnostate feels like almost too obvious a setting for your sci-fi dystopia, these days; if I wanted to read about a world where the fascists won I would just turn on the news ü§™ü§™ü§™ (\*crickets\*). But instead of a underworld badass a la Cyberpunk or a Christ figure rising from the subaltern masses better fit for a Rush song, we follow Jack: a social-climber and wage slave angling for a promotion from her scummy boss. In E.E., the ossification of identity categories blinds the ruling class from genderfuckery, ironically allowing Jack-- a GNC butch woman-- to legally pass as a man, like a [Female Husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_Husbands:_A_Trans_History) plucked from 1700's tabloids and dropped into the coming neonazi techno-dysopia.

## __what i'm watching__:

nothing : )

## __what i'm playing__:
i got recommended a numberphile video about [fucked up sudokus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB0-vG6rSM4) and now i feel my third eye getting pried open... maybe i'll become a sudoku master.

## __what i'm working on__:

For the longest time building this site would take 5+ minutes because the [plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) that pulls the images would just hang forever... and the cache never works in GitHub actions, so every image is fetched anew for every build. Then one of the websites I was hot-linking from went down, so the image went with it. I  So I'm looking into using the free tier of Cloudflare's S2 Object storage to create a personal CDN to try to get around the caching issue. 

## __something i liked__:
itsyaboypedro/pedro's website

i forget about the neocities activity feed all the time, but I was bored dogsitting this weekend and revisited it only to see [itsyaboypedro](https://itsyaboypedro.neocities.org) updated. 

i'd like to make my site more fun. i started playing with the idea of making HTML collages where i can forget about readability and just make glitchy, broken-looking stuff, but i don't have the time to really fuck with that. 

## __something i hated__:

I regret ever posting this fucking sissy islamification fetish image as a meme

Every once in a while in a while it gets a like from some kind of kink bot. They must be bots. A human being would understand that i posted this as a joke and I'm not into this.
