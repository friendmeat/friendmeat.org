## __what i'm reading__:

### the works of blake planty 

#### _a normal catboy story_

> Hell does not exist for catboys, as long as they don’t know the kind of guy who knows about hell.

in the delerious microcosm of _a normal catboy story_, doctors, supervisors, abductors, and the CIA establish byzantine rules for catboys outstripped only by the rules catboys make for themselves. catboys are medicalized, fetishized, analyzed-- by whom, it's hard to tell, as _normal catboy story_ is like the Foucauldian _disciplinary society_ of [_Nekopara_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekopara) spied through a smashed kaleidoscope: in a single page _story_ blends Disney's _Treasure Island_, BL manga, and outsider artists Charles Crumb, Henry Darger, and the Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly^[this is the [second time](https://friendmeat.org/blog/2025/05/24/weeklies-3-prelapsarian-schizoposting/) the Throne has been mentioned here] into a single apocalypse cult.

#### _The Passion of Kitty Angel Mindfreak: Director's Cut_

This should be one of your Caterion Closet picks-- if not for the special features, then just for the fact that in the widescreen remaster we can finally see all the sordid paraphernalia of Kitty Angel Mindfreak's terminal lifestyle the that was cropped for domestic broadcast. And if not that, then just for the fact that Kitty was my gay awakening.

### The Summer Hikaru Died (2025)

![Panels from "The Summer Hikaru Died" manga, from right to left: a hand entering from the bottom of the frame enters a slit in an anime boy's chest, which expands at the hand moves upward towards his chin.](https://i.postimg.cc/mZ0qdh2x/summer-hikaru-died.png)

The BL manga and queer indie comics I read in middle school had an overall deleterious effect on my mental health and self-esteem. Am I allowed to say that? 

<details><summary>CW: TMI</summary>
<p>BL has a palliative affective palette: it provides a soothing fantasy of intense emotions and innocent sexuality, and in my impressionable years it melted my adolescent brain into a yearning slurry. IMO, I would've been better prepared for life if we were sand-blasting the innocence out of adolescents assembly-line style with hardcore adult scenarios (divorce, paraphilia, war, etc.). My romantic streak is a constant source of anguish; it's added gasoline to the smoldering wreck of my love life and unbeknownst-to-me one-night-stands. I feel distinctly pathetic and laughable amongst my peers. </p></details>

Anyway, _The Summer Hikaru Died_.

The screencap above is of the sequence that sold me on it. I like how this particular image is visceral, uncomfortable, yonic, and erotic, all without being "obscene"^[I like obscenity though. Don't ever let anyone suggest otherwise.] enough to censor.

I caught up with the manga shortly after it started and then dropped it, which made Episode 1 very confusing since there's suddenly a bunch of characters that must've been introduced since I read it so the author could, like, have a plot, I guess.

The foundational trope is, I guess, so overdone as to be a Tumblr meme ("die and come back wrong"), but it still feels kind of undeniably compelling for the protagonist to be mourning his dead bestie while his "bestie-not-bestie" is right there. tarkovsky pure cinema.

But ultimately, like most anime, it's cowardly and rote. I'm gonna keep watching tho.

### hylics 2

![wayne from hylics dressed like a hype beast in a supreme tshirt and puffer jacket](https://i.redd.it/tvoex2ybly861.png)

I was looking around in [wplace.live](http://wplace.live/) and saw someone drew a Wayne Hylics right next to a Kim Discoelysium. It reminded me of how much I love Hylics and Disco Elysium. So Now I'm replaying Hylics 2.

Hylics 2 is a salve for the moment we're in where industrial volumes of toxic slop is polluting the noosphere in the name of number-go-up. While you could compare Mason Lindroth's art to the uncanny, "name a single thing in this picture" quality of adversarial-network imagery from a few years ago, unlike the vacuous swill accelerating our extinction it's all lovingly hand-made with blender and honest-to-god claymation. It's connoisseur's slop. 

P.S. Fuck poolmen. 

## __something i liked__:

### knowing how to use excel

i have no life so work is my main thing, and it's stressing me out right now. but at least I know how to use excel to make my life easier. Everyone says they can use excel but they can't.

I can use VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables. fuck with me.

## __something i hated__:
### trying to get a new screen protector

I'm one of those perverted freaks that uses a smartphone for 5 years instead of upgrading it every day. So that means it's basically illegal to buy accessories for it since the new model is a quarter of a millimeter wider, they added an extra front-facing camera for livestreaming straight to the NSA, and they took out the charging port to add a dedicated button for Bonzo Buddy.

first I tried to use a $5 diy thing where you cut the screen protector to the dimensions of your phone. It had two protectors and I fucked up both because I'm stupid. 

So instead I tried to order a $3 screen protector from Best Buy, and it was $5 for shipping so I tried to schedule it for pickup from the store because that was free. The day before it was supposed to be ready Best Buy emailed me 31 times that it wasn't available. The same email. 

So I still don't have a screen protector.

### wild crit drip encounter
![a t-shirt with _invaders_-style screenshot but the aliens are skulls. the text reads: "SYMBOLIC EXCHANGE AND DEATH; BY JEAN BAUDRILLARD"](https://i.postimg.cc/1z83ZM27/20250815-113618.jpg)

Guy in the coffee shop was wearing this crazy Baudrillard shirt. I said "that's a crazy-ass shirt" then I made him let me take this picture. Then I got the fuck out of there because I'm shy.
