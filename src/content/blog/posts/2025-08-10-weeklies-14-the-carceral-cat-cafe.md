## __what i'm reading__:
### negative space by b.r. yeager
> Jill seemed bummed. Like she was about to throw up. I don’t even know why he brought her. Chicks never got that stuff.
> I zoomed closer on my phone, and the dangling bodies looked almost like they were stuffed with cotton. Their crotches wet and dark, coffee-colored sludge dribbling from their pant legs. They swayed in the breeze. Almost like art. Trevor, Tad, Chris and Jason. Gone forever.
> “It’s beautiful,” Tyler said, sucking on purple-grey leaves.

i haven't read a _Goosebumps_ book since elementary school, maybe, but i remember an atmosphere of irreversibility. once the horror started, it would change the children in the books permanently, if they even survived. and a lot of the time they didn't. 

_negative space_ is like a grown-up _Welcome to Dead House_. b.r. yeager has remapped r.l. stine's blunt mechanisms of suger-rush tweendom onto the comparatively delicate years of late adolescence.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### _I AM MUSIC_ - playboi carti

![MOJO JOJO - playboi carti](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w5U7hemoc28)

the 2010s sucked for me so i generally turned away from pop culture. now i'm Old, my tastes are more developed, and i can approach pop music with less baggage. the working question for me now with music is, "does this fuck?" and i think playboi carti fucks. 

## __what i'm watching__:
### what is werewolf cybernetics by Auryn
[![title card of the talk "Werewolf Cybernetics"](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zqn2fg7futgveq3tlgze6d2e/bafkreigjk6ftu6wkz4t44lv3hrbfgezorwd4povvqmyhiprsfpdns3hnka@jpeg)](

)

this is a brilliantly pithy talk from the directory of _Rukus_. Auryn makes up for the brevity by expertly weaving an associative web with cinematic flourishes. they blaze tangential trails that make unexpected connections. there's not a conclusion or an ethic to draw here, but another signpost for a critical-theoretical Furry metalanguage, another important example being Patrician Taxxon's oft-cited [on the ethics of boinking animal people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws9g3igw51s).

## __something i liked__:
### a birthday present for myself

It has overlapping dialog boxes from like mixers and EQs, with "Audacity has crashed" on the top.](https://imgproxy.fourthwall.com/cAD4A-2-610pLItFeZLl5AYtsApTQIEGgZM_pAQF5lA/w:900/sm:1/enc/ziUm4tUfHmqIZ7HW/m_3m6ALVpBB2aYe2/xGh4TVLhC-w3FsI_/aoOpv8zS5FHMg-Eg/khaHwgKYReokYdcP/AzBgkNPxD1ge60jb/M8EJhj7csoYAvHbl/7LjsqOrx7IPi4xS1/mdx0h_KU6qLykyTT/eQRtEtpAICNWWm6h/QqwcoG2qXOebQ0z-/tCKicimGgdOFWOva/GdFYUoebUGYaax0p/oRFt1Pib_IYfK3e6/dVAZ3YFm7Ys)

i make money using audacity so it's only fair i should rep them.

## __something i hated__:
### labubu is satan dot com

my conspiracy theory is that every statement _vis a vis_ labubu is made only by a paid crisis actor. there is simply no way to have an opinion on labubu. if you're going to astroturf a moral panic at least make it less obvious.
