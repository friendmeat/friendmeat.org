## __what i'm reading__:
### *Devotions* by Mary Oliver
This was a book club pick and we had a wonderful conversation about giving dolphins LSD.

It's hard to read a poem about birds and plants and shit and not think it's corny. But once you read dozens of nature poems through years of a writer's ouvre you gotta start wondering if there's something to this shit? Like maybe nature *is* that dope even if you're not using big words about it? 

I think Mary Oliver could be an anarcho-primitivist and/or a therian.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### *The Slip* - Nine Inch Nails

I like listening to this while playing Attack/Defense mode in TF2 because I am, in fact, reaching the point.

## __what i'm watching__:
### *KIller Klowns from Outer Space* (1988)
This movie is a miracle. Where's the massive budget and artistic vision for awful movies in the 21st century? Also thrilled to discover the origin of [Bigtop Burger](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsQ2sraD5kopZgOmWCGoihtM5EXWs6IRr).

## __what i'm working on__:
### rooting a sketchy chinese phone
I got a [sketchy chinese smartphone](https://www.newegg.com/p/23B-00MR-00005) that has an E-Ink screen. I'm excited to use a phone that's slower and worse, but I can't daily-drive it until I get a new plan cuz AT&T doesn't like sketchy chinese phones. 

I'm also following [this guide](https://vbh.ai/hibreak-pro-guide-1-debloating-the-hibreak-pro-and-setting-up-private-dns/) to root and debloat it. Eventually I want to completely [de-googling](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/) it, and maybe even install an open-source Android ROM like [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/), if I can figure out how to do that without bricking it.

### self-hosting Pages CMS 
I use [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org/) for making my blog posts. It's awesome cuz you can just use Microsoft's computers for everything. But I'm thinking about using [custom fields](https://pagescms.org/docs/custom-fields/) to automatically crop banners for blog posts and make thumbnails for art uploads.
## __something i liked__:
Reading [*Christian Eschatology of Artificial Intelligence: Pastoral Technologies of Cybernetic Flesh*](https://www.librarystack.org/christian-eschatology-of-artificial-intelligence) on my sketchy e-ink phone. It's very nice for the eyes.
