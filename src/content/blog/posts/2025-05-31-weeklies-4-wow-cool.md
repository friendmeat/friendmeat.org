### _Raw Dog: The Naked Truth About Hot Dogs_ by Jamie Loftus
Jamie Loftus came to my city on her book tour to support the release of the paperback edition. I'm a big fan of the work she does contextualizing the subjects on [16th Minute](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-sixteenth-minute-of-fame-172216473/).  

I have hot dogs orbiting my head like a dazed cartoon. I've never been so hungry for those fuckers. Even during the part where she tried to make the hypersaccharine meat goop they're made from sound unappetizing. 


## __what i'm listening to__:
### a random techno mix on mixcloud
I'm in an arms race with sp\*tify. I use [ReVanced](https://revanced.app) to crack the app and they keep on patching it. Occasionally, they invalidate my password and I have to reset it. They did that this week and I didn't have time to the crack back up before I went to the gym, so when I got on the treadmill I went on [mixcloud](https://mixcloud.com) and pressed play on a random techno set. It was some British guy (who else?) with some really unbearable producer tag. But before I knew it, I had run over a mile. Fuck it, I thought, I'll keep going. My calves still fucking hurt. Thanks British techno DJ guy.

## __what i'm watching__:
![Vulcanizadora (2025)](https://www.rogerebert.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MV5BZTUzNmY4YjctY2VhNC00NWY4LTk2ZDUtMWZkNjgzYmRmYTIyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg)
### _Vulcanizadora_ (2025)
Awesome fucking movie about 40 year old duded lighting fireworks in the woods. I have hope for American cinema now. 

![The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives](https://img.rgstatic.com/content/show/ec8f4974-067e-4cc8-a449-b7c1206736c5/poster-500.jpg)
### The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives (Season 2)
I'm gonna show my ass as a reality show philistine: I cannot keep these people straight. Why does everyone look the same. Why does everyone look like that.

## __something i liked__:
### overpaying for hand-made ceramics
there was an arts festival in my city this past weekend, so I got a crock, a nice mug, and a sunburn. Yippee!

## __something i hated__:
### the publishing industry's stranglehold on lending libraries
On either Hoopla or Libby I saw a big banner ad that was advertising that a certain book could be borrowed by anyone, without limits, instead of the "1 ebook = 1 book" bullshit, without a shred of irony that the publishing industry [slapped the Internet Archive with a lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_v._Internet_Archive) for doing the same thing at the height of the Covid epidemic.

Fuck publishing companies, fuck copyright, fuck capitalism, fuck all private property, and fuck the United States of America.
