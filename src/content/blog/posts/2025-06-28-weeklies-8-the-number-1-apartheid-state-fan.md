## __what i'm reading__:
### deleuze on the genocide of palestinians
> “It’s said that this is not a genocide. And yet it’s a story that consists of many Oradours [a French village destroyed by the Nazis in retaliation against the Resistance], from the very beginning. Zionist terrorism was practiced not solely against the English, but on the Arab villages which had to disappear; Irgun was very active in this respect (Deir Yassin). From beginning to end, it involved acting as if the Palestinian people not only must not exist, but had never existed at all. 
> 
> The conquerors were those who had themselves suffered the greatest genocide in history. Of this genocide the Zionists have made an absolute evil. But transforming the greatest genocide in history into an absolute evil is a religious and mystical vision, not a historical vision. It doesn’t stop the evil; on the contrary, it spreads the evil, makes it fall once again on other innocents, demands reparation that makes these others suffer part of what the Jews suffered (expulsion, restriction to ghettos, disappearance as a people). With ‘colder’ means than genocide, one ends up with the same result.”

*–Gilles Deleuze, qtd. ["Zionism Breaks" by Alberto Toscano](https://proteanmag.com/2025/06/22/zionism-breaks/)*

Went to my local gun show (it was something to do) and saw a car in the parking lot with Confederate flag and Isreal bumper stickers. Apartheid states have a #1 fan.

can we take a moment to appreciate how bad these covers are:

![Generic flat graphic star icons on a #ffffff black background, again with the title in a sans-serif font](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.kobo.com%2Fbook-images%2Fb76d8148-cc93-421c-b787-efab573b2ca3%2F353%2F569%2F90%2FFalse%2Fstars-in-my-pocket-like-grains-of-sand-1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=db0190925d4d34997fc7b6d9580df884d63367c099e7bbe204ec882bad9da0f5)

If I'd seen any of these in a book store I'd skip them instantly, though each one gives me a different reason:
1. looks like some knock-off john green netflix-bait. 
2. looks like some knock-off carl sagan nobel-bait
3. looks like a self-published fanfiction with the copywritten words Ctrl-F'd and published on Amazon for $0.99. 

None of them belie the fact you're about to read some Le-Guin level genderfuckery--

Wait. what do you mean he endorsed NAMBLA.
