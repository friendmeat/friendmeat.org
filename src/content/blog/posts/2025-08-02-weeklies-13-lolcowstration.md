<details><summary>CW Scat</summary><p> Someone would egg him on, or he would look at some furry porn, and he’d relapse and eat his shit again. By the time I knew about him he must have been doing this long enough that he kept ending up in hospital with infections and shit from the scat-eating. The moment he got out, he would always be like, ‘Okay, that was the last time I am never eating doodie EVER again,’ a promise that everyone knew he’d break. And yeah. Then he broke it, went to hospital, came out, swore off the shit, ate it anyway, on and on and on. I … as I said, some people egged him on. They got him to take pictures and videos by the end of it. I don’t think any of us thought it would end. He seemed to enjoy it, so we were helping him out in a way. Removing his inhibitions. But then he was like, ‘Oh God, the doctors told me that if I don’t stop I’m going to die. They want to institutionalise me.’ We called him a coward and told him he had to keep going. And then he posted a video of him chowing down on his shit, one last video. That was the last we heard from him. Someone found an obituary a little while later, and someone from the hospital who knew about the case leaked some of his details.”</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have told you that if I wasn’t high. I shouldn’t have told you it. Sorry.”</p>

I started listening to [a 6-hour podcast](https://www.patreon.com/posts/rwyasn-2-routine-134957424) from some guy about William Burroughs and _Naked Lunch_ and he interviewed Alison about this book. I liked _Tell Me I'm Worthless_ but... idk I just feel like it could be a lot bleaker. Too much joy in these books for me.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### _Miss E... So Addictive_ (2001)

![Missy Elliot - For My People (Basement Jaxx Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmdF7X5Lm2A)

so many of these songs going on my gym playlist

there's something about 90s/00s rap & RnB that the modern pastiches like Erika de Casier (as much as I like her) don't quite measure up to. Is it the mixing? The vocal layering? The personalities? IDK. 

Honorable mention to OutKast's [_outhernplayalisticadillacmuzik_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFofKGKlWo4) 
## __what i'm watching__:
### castration movie vol 1: traps (2024)

![castration movie vol. 1: traps](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ceab7aa0512690001ad653f/68d2b70d-8b05-4685-84af-6f084b1c1765/mHGV4HGXYyyfTuoLEeB1Z20FUui.jpg)

i can't help but smile every time people start yelling at each other in _castration movie vol. 1_ cause it's so inane. and I love when Traps (the character) says something insanely out of pocket and mean to her friends. we love BPD girlies.

## __something i liked__:
### does ACAB include unarmed security guards? 
probably, but the part-timer that fills in on weekends told me about all the times he's been arrested protesting oil pipelines and coal plants. cool guy

## __something i hated__:
### my lolcow era
i've slipped into a lolcow era. since watching Alex Novell [expose some guy for murder]() my algorithm has been awash with the second-order parasitical milieu that trades in the aftermarket dregs of crises livestreamed by the homeless and/or the mentally ill. they save the VODs, screenshot the forums and FOIA the arrest records but pontificate on "not getting involved"(!). awful. I'll watch it for hours.
