## __what i'm reading__:
### _CCRU_
I finished reading _Writings 1996-2003_ and this is my review

## __what i'm listening to__:
### _Ill Conceived_
The thesis of this very un-fun podcast is that natalism is the undergirding belief system that ties together a lot of disparate political positions, from milquetoast christian puriteens to neonazi nationalists. I'm never going to forgive this podcast for making me listen to Elon Musk speaking with his stupid fucking accent. 

Also one of the first things when you duckduckgo June Sternbach is the KiwiFarm thread doxxing her. Their moms must be so proud that they're obsessed with cyberstalking random trans shitposters.

## __what i'm watching__:
### some british guy playing half-life 2 custom maps
VODs of streamers on youtube can be really fucking annoying because they think screaming is funny. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c3UwSBpSkM) just plays custom HL2 maps and is chill.

apparently he's australian but im keeping the "british" in the title cause they're all freaks.

## __what i'm playing__:
### _Myst_
I'm the OG crusty-ass 480p Myst. I'm not very far and I've already had to consult a guide. Some of these aren't even puzzles, they're just fuck-yous. 


## __what i'm working on__:
### trying to compile FFmpeg and Whisper.cpp with CUDA support on WSL2
the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#ffmpeg-support-linux-only) integration for [FFmpeg 8.0](https://ayosec.github.io/ffmpeg-filters-docs/8.0/Filters/Audio/whisper.html) could be _extremely_ helpful for me at work, where I work with a lot of video and generate a lot of subtitles-- if I could compile either of them. Neither of them have pre-built binaries available. It's been a nightmare. I keep getting runtime errors about CUDA and the kernel.

**UPDATE**
I fucking did it. Fuck. I had to downgrade to CUDA Toolkit 12.9 because my GPU's architecture didn't have the latest "compute capability" and the 13.0 toolkit deprecated support for it.

I only had to completely wipe my WSL2 distro twice. And build half a dozen dependencies. 

On the bright side I did a lot of Sudoku waiting for the compilations to finish. Yay for time theft!!!

## __something i liked__:
the guy at the smoothie place knows my name : )

## __something i hated__:
i had a dream about eating moldy food and the next day my teeth hurt : (
