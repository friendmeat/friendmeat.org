## __what i'm reading__:
### "Inside the Architectonic Order of the Eschaton" - CCRU, _Writing 1997-2003_
> Such tactics are accompanied at the macro-social level by a media-oriented strategy, designed to exhaust conspiracy theory with selective diversionary assassinations, deliberately plotted for baroque complexity. The JFK hit was exemplary. AOE had no problems with the man-- if anything, they liked him-- but the opportunity was too good to miss. Live TV and radio, video footage, three different angles of fire, obvious dupe (himself assassinated by another obvious dupe), Cubans, Mafiosi, Pentagon involvement, meticulously composed FBI lies, multiple inquiries, innumerable books, and-- just to stop things cooling off-- a blockbuster movie. This might be small beer for the guys who exterminated the dinosaurs, but it sufficed to lead paranoid social critique into a dead-end labyrinth for close-on thirty-six years...

I wonder if CCRU is cribbing off [Operation Mindfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism#Operation_Mindfuck) or if this is just the natural evolutionary convergence of unifying troll-theories of conspiracism Ã  la carcinization.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### _45 Pounds_ - YHWH Nailgun
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22KgeHLoJgI)

This shit comes on shuffle and I start fantasizing about chasing senators.

## __what i'm watching__:
### _Rosswood_

_Marble Hornets_ is the The Velvet Underground of analog horror. Not everyone watched Marble Hornets, but everyone who watched Marble Hornets started their own found footage/slenderverse series.

The MH guys are set up for a sophomore slump issue since their first project was so monumental, but in _Rosswood_ I think they prove they've still got it. 

### tiktok compilations where people get hurt
TikTok is truly some nightmarish shit but there's an "America's Funniest Home Videos"-shaped hole in my heart that's filled by these compilations-- ON YOUTUBE. I don't and will never have a tiktok account. 

## __what i'm playing__:
### puzzle games at work
the folks in the [whodunnit](https://bsky.app/profile/whodunnitvn.bsky.social) discord have turned me on to [cluesbysam](https://cluesbysam.com). I've been looking for some shit like this. It also reminded me to get back onto the [cemantle](https://cemantle.certitudes.org/) grind.

## (_NEW_) __what i'm working on__:
### game dev with ebitengine
I'm add this section just to show you this shit:

i'm playing with [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) to learn Go and game dev and i feel fucking stupid. I spent multiple days trying to get a sprite to move with arrow keys and I'm still not satisfied with the results.

I was so proud of figuring out how to make things collide that I spent more time this week figuring out how to embed Web Assembly than trying to add more features, just so I could show it to _you_, the reader. So here:

The raccoons might spawn inside each other or in walls. Just refresh the page.

## __something i liked__:
### Cursed Media Podcast Network
https://www.cursedmedia.net/

I guess $25/yr is more than most people pay for podcasts but I really, really wanted to listen to _Science in Transition_ and _Perverts_, and it's less than, like, the lowest tier of someone's Patreon.

I'm mad they stole my idea for the _Perverts_ podcast since I rubberneck in weird fetish forums online for fun.

## __something i hated__:
apparently you're not allowed to post deformed deer stillbirth on Scruff.

## __a picture__:
I'm counting the bouncing raccoons as the picture of the week
