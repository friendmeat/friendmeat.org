- **what i'm reading**: [From Plato to the Moving Image: Notes on Lynchian Ethics](https://bluelabyrinths.com/2025/02/05/from-plato-to-the-moving-image-notes-on-lynchian-ethics/) by Claudio Kulesko

> An eidetic approach to images is undeniable throughout Lynch’s filmography. Whenever the cinematic continuum is interrupted, torn apart from the inside by a sudden eruption of visions, hallucinations, or revelations, it is the idea that emerges with arrogance from the deep waters of the unconscious. An unconscious that is not only individual but also social, historical, cultural, spectacular, biological, geological, and cosmic. Therefore, the idea seems to be born from an “inside” that is always and intrinsically “outside”, like a Möbius ribbon that criss-crosses and binds everything that exists.

>

> Now, one might ask: What are these images? What do they mean? What do they want from us?
