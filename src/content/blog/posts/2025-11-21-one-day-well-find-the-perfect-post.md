description: on the perfectibility of posting
---
one day we'll find the perfect post. it will say everything better than you ever could, and exactly the way you meant it. You'll find yourself quoting the perfect post in daily life. it will be the quintessential incising critique; it will acknowledge every entanglement. the perfect post will resolve all dialetics into a discursive mist. 

the tone of the perfect post will convey both the urgency and measured forethought appropriate. the perfect post will be as aphorism, but better. the perfect post will be less than two inches wide when printed in 12 point font on a screen. the perfect post will punish all sins and reward all virtues.

we _will_ find the perfect post. but we must ferry its gestation. we cannot stop posting. we cannot stop perfecting our posting. we do not know who will author the perfect post, but we know its perfection will be imbued into them retroactively, and the author will crystallize into a timeless dharma. 

someday we'll find the perfect post.
