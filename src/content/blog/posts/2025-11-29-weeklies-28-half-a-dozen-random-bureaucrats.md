## __what i'm reading__:

> thinking about the storefronts that are lit all night and the planes passing overhead. what it would take to allow quiet, dark, peace, back into the world. arguments i have in my head with neighbors, strangers. what would happen if all the planes are grounded - my job, which i do think is good, collapsing almost overnight.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### _Tranquilizer_ - Oneohtrix Point Never
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZMzLZJu6Qg&pp=ygUVb25lb2h0cml4IHBvaW50IG5ldmVy)
Maybe I'm a fake fan for preferring the more active songs on _GoD_, _R+7_, _Age of_ and _Magic OPN_-- the ones that are fast and poppy-- but OPN's textured soundscapes are just inimitable. Too 'loud' for ambient, too 'quiet' for noise-- digital psychedelia. I can't wait to take a bath with this album.

## __what i'm watching__:
### *Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb* (1964)

The only thing the U.S. government and I agree on is that _Dr. Strangelove_ is an awesome movie. But why is this just a documentary about 2025. Why is "protecting precious bodily fluids from Communist corruption" the platform of every politician. Why is Elon Musk Dr. Strangelove, literally complete with uncontrollable sieg-heiling.

### *A House of Dynamite* (2025)
Now what if *Dr. Strangelove* sucked and was stupid?

Here's my shortlist of things in this movie that were shit:

**Cinematography** - I blame *Succession* for making people think you can shoot dramas like _The Office_. It is so fucking vertigo-inducing.

**Special Effects** - I swear to god they did the titles in iMovie. The rocket launches looked like Xbox. If you're dick-riding for the government this hard they could at least give you some fucking archival stock footage of a real rocket launch. SMFH. 

**Characters** - Instead of focusing on a tight cast, we get half a dozen random bureaucrats each of whom receives a few minutes of screen-time and a one-liner. That can be okay with a strong vision-- I couldn't tell you what happens or who anyone is in Tarkovsky's _The Mirror_, which is one of my favorite movies-- but the the writers are sullied with making you care about everyone, so they lean on the crutch of "i have a partner and/or kid, so I care if the country explodes!" What the fuck ever, bro. And I just can't take seriously the idea that the government is comprised of people with any kind of standards or seriousness. We're literally being run by podcasters.

"What if they made sudoku way harder" said no one, ever. 

## __what i'm working on__:

I'm hand-knitting gifts for my besties. WIP.

## __something i liked__:

my vegan gravy was a hit at thanksgiving : )

## __something i hated__:

The plastic sheets I bought to cover my drafty-ass 100-year-old windows are literally 2 inches too short to cover the whole thing, so I have to make up the difference with literal plastic wrap and tape.
