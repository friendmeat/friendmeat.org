chapter one of jars is everything i love in indie webcomics. furries in very grounded dramas with low interpersonal stakes. grungy gays with parental issues. casual homo domesticity. surreal psychological interludes. weird, traumatized kids.

very, very excited for further chapters. I want to know everything about these little guys. 

i also gotta thank mammalfriend's OC playlists for getting me into Brainiac and Black Eyes

hold on. they made a [page for their characters](https://jarsjarsjars.com/characters) where they all have myspace-style statuses with blinkie badges. we're so fucking back.

<summary>CW for rape, murder, CSA</summary>
<blockquote>
"Like the man says, ain't nothin' you can do in this world today—go to the pictures, buy some food, or even throw away the package it come in—that don't bring somebody closer to hurt. At least this way you know that you ain't makin' your money by makin' them pictures or packages. And when you're hurtin' someone, you're hurtin' 'em. You look 'em right in the eye and do it. You can't very well fuck somebody without lookin' 'em in the eye, unless—" Hogg chuckled— "you do it doggy-style. Even so, you ain't droppin' no bombs on five hundred people you ain't never seen. You ain't signin' no papers that's gonna put a thousand people who ain't never heard your name out of a house and a job. You ain't enjoyin' no benefits that come down the pike three years after you finished with hurtin' folks you didn't even know existed, much less you was hurtin' them. And you can look at any TV newscast or listen to any radio report, even if it's about somethin' you just done—and I had that happen to me three times now—and know you got more sense of duty than they do!"

i'm starting to wonder if reading lots of books that are just pornographic descriptions of CSA is good for my mental health.

## __what i'm listening to__:
### matmos's secret lavender marriage lore

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1797616317/size=large/bgcol=181a1b/linkcol=056cc4/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2468687975/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://matmos.bandcamp.com/album/quasi-objects">Quasi-Objects by Matmos</a></iframe>


i was listening to Quasi-Objects in my car and they had this rhythmic clicking going on. after about a minute i began to suspect it wasn't the song because they don't just let a single element ride for that long. turns out it was just my shitty aux cable not connecting to my phone and glitching out.

being an experimental music fan means experiencing this all the--

## __what i'm watching__:

### death race 2000
![Death Race 2000](https://media.themoviedb.org/t/p/w440_and_h660_face/mIKixibiKnUqTmxJ3IdSK8HoPmK.jpg)

awful and incredible in the way only 70s movies can be. in a futuristic united states under the 20-year reign of Mr. President (a political and spiritual leader residing in a palace in China), the national hero is a brooding, amoral antihero in full-body black leather whom everyone fantasizes about being killed by[^1]. 

I'd make these changes in a modern reboot:
- IRL twitch streamers instead of randomly themed mascots
- Make the terrorists cooler
- replace the lame ketchup-on-shirt shit they've got going on for the vehicular manslaughter with really visceral gore
- Make it somehow even more misogynistic
- Make its message somehow even less politically comprehensible

after I googled Vulcanizadora to fact-check last week's post i found out that it's a sequel??? Potrykus is on some Todd Solondz shit.
## __something i liked__:

### ai code agents actually slow developers down

[haha suck my dick](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/07/12/016247/ai-slows-down-some-experienced-software-developers-study-finds)

## __something i hated__:
### the cloaciform regime: they took the damn holes out of my damn phone. 

the last time i had a cord-cutting phase and tried to get rid of spotify, i bought a 64gb SD card for my phone and those things are NOT CHEAP. then in like, a month, i changed plans and had to get a new phone. and there's no aux cable and no sd card slot. and this is because big tech treats us like lobotomized piggies who wallow in their slop and are grateful for it. fuck big tech.
